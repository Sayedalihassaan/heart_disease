# Heart Disease Prediction Using Artificial Neural Networks and xgboost and RandomForestClassifier

## Overview

This repository contains code and resources for predicting heart disease using an artificial neural network (ANN). The model is trained on the heart_disease dataset, which includes various patient attributes and heart disease presence indicators.

## Model Architecture

Type: Artificial Neural Network (ANN)
Layers: [Describe the layers, activation functions, etc.]
Optimizer: [Specify the optimizer used (e.g., Adam)]
Loss Function: [Specify the loss function used (e.g., binary crossentropy)]
Evaluation Metrics: [List the evaluation metrics used (e.g., accuracy, AUC-ROC)]
